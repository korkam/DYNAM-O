# Toolbox Development - Watershed TFpeaks and SO-power/phase Histograms



* This branch is for development of optimization based on changes to the edge graphs during the merging process:
  - Don't make it a digraph (unidirectional)
  - Fix the overall graph representation and have real merges. I tried this in the past but the matlab graph implementation is very slow.
